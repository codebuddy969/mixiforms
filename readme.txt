Mixiforms, a small builder plugin, designed to quickly integrate forms into your posts.

== Description ==

How to use the plugin.

Activate the plugin and step to Builder option, customize your form by clicking on one of seven field types, under fields tab.

You can edit each field by clicking on a little gear icon or remove it by clicking on the trash icon button.

After you're happy with your newly created form, hit the save button and move to the option page called Mixiforms.

Locate the "Identifier" column from the table, find the row with your newly created form and copy the identifier key.

Now open any post in editor mode, and paste wherever you would like the identifier just copied, surrounded by double curly brackets: {{ka9ve2sm}}

On post update the identifier will be automatically replaced with your form template.
